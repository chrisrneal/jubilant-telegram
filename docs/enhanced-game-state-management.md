# Enhanced Game State Management

This document describes the robust game state management system implemented for the interactive story application.

## Overview

The enhanced game state management system provides comprehensive tracking of player progress, including choices made, scenarios visited, inventory items, and player statistics. The system supports serialization/deserialization for persistent storage and graceful handling of legacy data.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Game State Tracking

- **Visited Scenarios**: Tracks all story nodes the player has visited to prevent duplicate entries
- **Choice History**: Records every choice made with timestamps, including the choice text and resulting node
- **Inventory Management**: Full item management with quantities, acquisition dates, and descriptions
- **Player Statistics**: Flexible system for tracking any player attributes (health, mana, flags, etc.)
- **Gameplay Statistics**: Tracks start time, total choices made, and current play session

### 2. Robust Serialization and Deserialization

- **Schema Versioning**: All progress data includes a version number for future compatibility
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation ensures data integrity
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of corrupted or invalid data
- **Legacy Migration**: Automatic migration of old data formats to current schema

### 3. Backend Integration for Persistence

- **Supabase Integration**: Full integration with Supabase for authenticated users
- **Fallback Mode**: Graceful degradation when database is unavailable
- **Session Management**: Supports both authenticated and anonymous sessions
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles concurrent access through versioning and timestamps

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Enhanced Type Definitions (`lib/supabase.ts`)

```typescript
export interface ProgressData {
  visitedScenarios: string[]
  choiceHistory: ChoiceRecord[]
  inventory: PlayerInventory
  playerStats: PlayerStats
  gameplayStats: {
    startTime: string
    totalChoicesMade: number
    currentPlaySession: string
  }
  version: number
}

export interface ChoiceRecord {
  nodeId: string
  choiceId: string
  choiceText: string
  nextNodeId: string
  timestamp: string
}

export interface PlayerInventory {
  [itemId: string]: {
    name: string
    quantity: number
    acquiredAt: string
    description?: string
  }
}
```

#### 2. Game State Manager (`lib/game-state-manager.ts`)

The `GameStateManager` class provides static methods for managing game state:

- `createInitialProgressData()`: Creates a new, empty progress data structure
- `recordChoice()`: Records a player choice with full details
- `recordVisitedScenario()`: Tracks visited story nodes
- `addInventoryItem()`/`removeInventoryItem()`: Manages player inventory
- `updatePlayerStat()`: Updates player statistics
- `validateProgressData()`: Validates data structure integrity
- `migrateProgressData()`: Migrates legacy data to current format
- `serializeGameState()`/`deserializeGameState()`: Handles data serialization

#### 3. Enhanced Story Service (`lib/story-service.ts`)

The story service has been enhanced with:

- Automatic choice recording when saving game state
- Visited scenario tracking
- Progress data validation and migration
- Better error handling for invalid data

#### 4. Updated API Endpoints (`pages/api/game-state.ts`)

API endpoints now include:

- Comprehensive data validation on all operations
- Automatic migration of legacy data
- Enhanced error reporting
- Fallback mode support

### User Interface Enhancements

The story page now displays:

- **Real-time Progress Indicators**: Shows choices made, scenes explored, and play time
- **Inventory Display**: Shows acquired items when available
- **Progress Statistics**: Visual indicators of player advancement
- **Data Source Indicators**: Clear indication of whether using database or fallback mode

## Usage Examples

### Recording a Choice

```typescript
// In the story component
const handleChoice = async (nextNodeId: string, choiceId: string, choiceText: string) => {
  const updatedGameState = await StoryService.saveGameState(
    sessionId,
    storyId,
    nextNodeId,
    undefined, // Let service handle progress updates
    {
      choiceId,
      choiceText,
      previousNodeId: currentNodeId
    }
  )
}
```

### Managing Inventory

```typescript
// Add an item to inventory
let progressData = GameStateManager.addInventoryItem(
  progressData,
  'magic_sword',
  'Enchanted Blade',
  1,
  'A sword that glows with magical energy'
)

// Check if player has an item
if (GameStateManager.hasInventoryItem(progressData, 'magic_sword')) {
  // Player has the sword
}
```

### Tracking Player Stats

```typescript
// Update a player stat
progressData = GameStateManager.updatePlayerStat(progressData, 'health', 85)

// Get a player stat
const health = GameStateManager.getPlayerStat(progressData, 'health')
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Progress Tracking**: No player action is lost
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy saves continue to work
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tracking features
4. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and validation
5. **Performance**: Efficient data structures and operations
6. **User Experience**: Real-time progress indicators enhance engagement

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests covering:

- Initial data creation
- Choice recording and tracking
- Inventory management
- Data validation and migration
- Serialization/deserialization
- Error handling scenarios

## Security and Privacy

- User data is properly isolated by session/user ID
- All data operations include validation
- Fallback mode ensures no data loss
- Minimal data collection (only game progress)

## Future Enhancements

The system is designed to easily support:

- Achievement tracking
- More complex inventory mechanics
- Player relationship tracking
- Advanced statistics and analytics
- Export/import functionality
- Cloud saves across devices
